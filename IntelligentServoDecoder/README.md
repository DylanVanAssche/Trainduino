IntelligentServoDecoder
-------------------

Intelligent Servo Decoder is a DCC servo decoder with built-in wireless S88 feedback.
By reading the servo potmeter we can determine the real position of the servo and send those values back to the command station.
A nice cheap alternative to those expensive Railcom+ decoders (they only provide some ACK to the command station but no real position readings!).
