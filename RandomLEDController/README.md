RandomLEDController
===================

Controls a day/night process on my modelroad. It works with a cylcus of 24 minutes. 
Every minute counts the Arduino as one 'hour'. After the whole cyclus, the Arduino resets the timer.
The RandomLEDController can control 14 LED's in houses and has also 1 output for the streetlights.
